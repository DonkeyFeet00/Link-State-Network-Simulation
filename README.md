# Link-State-Network-Simulation

tentative plan
* make a "router" class
  *  variables:
   *  Name (e.g., R1)
   *  Neighbors (List of the directly connected routers)
   *  Cost (Cost of links between the router and the directly connected neighbors - the cost represents the delay of communication on that link in milliseconds)
   *  Destinations (List of all routers in the network)
   *  Routing table
   *
